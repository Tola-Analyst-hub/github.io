# Project 1

**Title:** [TURNOVER INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD](https://github.com/Tola-Analyst-hub/github.io/blob/main/Shital%20Corporations%20Report.pbix)

**Tools Used:** SQL, POWERBI (Slicers, Pivot Chart, DAX, Bar Chart, Visual Header Tooltips, Measures)

**Project Description:**
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and visualization of UK business turnover data across different company types, statuses, and regions using a tax-related dataset. The purpose was to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery phase affected business turnover across various sectors and geographic locations.
I developed SQL queries to clean, transform, and analyze the dataset and used Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs). The insights provided stakeholders with a clear view of business performance trends during and after the COVID period.

**Business Objective**
To evaluate the economic impact of COVID-19 and post-pandemic recovery on UK business turnover.
To identify which sectors and regions drove growth or experienced decline during 2020–2024.
To aid government departments or financial institutions in identifying vulnerable sectors and potential areas for support or investment.

**Problems Addressed:**
Understanding how different company types (e.g., Retail, Farming, Manufacturing) performed financially from 2020 to 2024.
Measuring turnover changes year-on-year by sector and company status (Active, Closed, In Liquidation).
Identifying regional disparities in business performance using total turnover as a benchmark.
Assessing business incorporation behavior through analysis of incorporation months.

**Key findings:** 

Using SQL and Power BI, the following insights and KPIs were delivered:
1. Turnover Change Between 2020–2024 by Company Type: Showed growth trends by sector.
2. Top 15 Regional Performance by Total Turnover: Identified high-performing regions.
3. Bottom 15 Regional Performance by Total Turnover: Highlighted underperforming regions.
4. Sectors Showing Greatest Increase and Decrease Over the Years: Offers a snapshot of sectoral impact.
5. Total Turnover by Company Status: Compared turnover performance between active, closed, and liquidated businesses.
6. Turnover by Month-on-Month Performance: Provided time series trends in business turnover.

SQL-Based Questions Addressed:
1. Which sectors show the greatest increase and decrease in turnover over the years available?
2. What is the total turnover for “Farming” broken down by year?
3. What is the LEAST common month to incorporate a business? Is this true for all Company Types?
